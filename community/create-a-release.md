title: Create a Kvrocks release
---

This document mainly introduces how the Release Manager releases a new version in accordance with the Apache requirements.

## Introduction

* Source Release is the key point which Apache values, also, is necessary for a release;
* Binary Release is optional. Kvrocks can choose whether to release the binary package to the Apache repository or not.

Note that for binary distribution packages, it is necessary to check that the new version does not contain third-party dependencies.

Please remember that publishing software has legal consequences. This guide complements the foundation-wide policies and guides:

* [Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)
* [Release Distribution Policy](https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution)
* [Release Creation Process](https://infra.apache.org/release-publishing.html)

## Adding GPG KEY

This section is a brief from the [Cryptography with OpenPGP](https://infra.apache.org/openpgp.html) guideline.

:::note

This section is the requirements for release manager who is the first time to be a release manager

:::

### Install gpg

For more details, please refer to [GPG official website](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html). Here shows one approach to install GPG with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew install gnupg
gpg --version #check the version, should be 2.x
```

### Generate gpg Key

Attentions:

* Name is best to keep consistent with your full name of Apache ID;
* Email should be the Apache email;
* Name is best to only use English to avoid garbled.

Run `gpg --full-gen-key` and complete the generation interactively:

This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1 # input 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096 # input 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0 # input 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y # input y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Hulk Lin               # input your name
Email address: hulk@apache.org    # input your email
Comment:                          # input some annotations, optional
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Hulk <hulk@apache.org>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O # input O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

# key generatio[n will be done after your inputting the key with the following output
gpg: key E49B00F626B marked as ultimately trusted
gpg: revocation certificate stored as '/Users/hulk/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/F77B887A4F25A9468C513E9AA3008E49B00F626B.rev'
public and secret key created and signed.

pub   rsa4096 2022-07-12 [SC]
      F77B887A4F25A9468C513E9AA3008E49B00F626B
uid           [ultimate] hulk <hulk@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096 2022-07-12 [E]
```

### Upload your key to public gpg keyserver

Firstly, list your key:

```shell
gpg --list-keys
```

The output is like:

```text
-------------------------------
pub   rsa4096 2022-07-12 [SC]
      F77B887A4F25A9468C513E9AA3008E49B00F626B
uid           [ultimate] hulk <hulk@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096 2022-07-12 [E]
```

Then, send your key id to key server:

```shell
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key <key-id> # e.g., F77B887A4F25A9468C513E9AA3008E49B00F626B
```

Among them, `keys.openpgp.org` is a randomly selected keyserver, you can use `keyserver.ubuntu.com` or any other full-featured keyserver.

### Check whether the key is created successfully

Uploading takes about one minute, after that, you can check by your email at the corresponding keyserver.

Uploading keys to the keyserver is mainly for joining a [Web of Trust](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#web-of-trust).

### Add your gpg public key to the KEYS document

:::info

SVN is required for this step.

:::

The svn repository of the release branch is: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/kvrocks

Please always add the public key to KEYS in the release branch:

```shell
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/kvrocks kvrocks-dist
# As this step will copy all the versions, it will take some time. If the network is broken, please use svn cleanup to delete the lock before re-execute it.
cd kvrocks-dist
(gpg --list-sigs YOUR_NAME@apache.org && gpg --export --armor YOUR_NAME@apache.org) >> KEYS # Append your key to the KEYS file
svn add .	# It is not needed if the KEYS document exists before.
svn ci -m "add gpg key for YOUR_NAME" # Later on, if you are asked to enter a username and password, just use your apache username and password.
```

### Upload the GPG public key to your GitHub account

1. Enter https://github.com/settings/keys to add GPG KEYS.
2. Please remember to bind the email address used in the GPG key to your GitHub account (https://github.com/settings/emails) if you find "unverified" after adding it.

## Create source releases and stage

1. Checkout to the RELEASE BRANCH and cherry-pick commits to release
2. Use `./x.py package source -v ${release_version} -rc ${candidate_number}` to create release tarball
3. Make sure it compiles good and push tag to GitHub

## Upload artifacts to SVN dist repo

:::info

SVN is required for this step.

:::

The svn repository of the dev branch is: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/kvrocks

First, checkout Kvrocks to local directory:

```shell
# As this step will copy all the versions, it will take some time. If the network is broken, please use svn cleanup to delete the lock before re-execute it.
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/kvrocks kvrocks-dist-dev
```

Then, upload the artifacts:

```shell
cd kvrocks-dist-dev
mkdir ${release_version} # create a directory named by version
cp ${repo_dir}/apache-kvrocks-${release_version}-incubating-src.tar.gz* ${release_version}/ # copy source code and signature package to the versioned directory
svn status # check svn status
svn add ${release_version} # add to svn
svn status # check svn status
svn commit -m "Prepare for ${release_version}"     # commit to SVN remote server
```

## Build and push Docker images

:::info

Docker and Docker Buildx is required for this step. Docker Buildx should be bundled with Docker Desktop. If you don't use Docker Desktop, please follow the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/build/install-buildx/) to install it.

:::

1. `docker login` to your own DockerHub account.
2. Build and push docker images to your personal repository on DockerHub:
3. MORE BUILD ARGS can be adjusted according to the performance of your computer

```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --tag ${your_dockerhub_username}/kvrocks:${release_version} --tag ${your_dockerhub_username}/kvrocks:latest . --output "type=registry" --build-arg MORE_BUILD_ARGS=-j12
```
