| MIGRATE    | ✓                | v2.0.6        | Migrate slots between cluster nodes. |

:::note

To guarantee the correctness of client SDK, we rename the `CLUSTER` command to `CLUSTERX` to prevent the topology can being modified casually, but we can still use the `CLUSTER` command to fetch the cluster topology information.

:::note

The response of `DBSIZE` and keyspace section of `INFO` is updated asynchronously after executing `DBSIZE SCAN` command.

Before 2.15.0, Kvrocks only allowed using [the namespace feature](https://kvrocks.apache.org/docs/namespace) to isolate your data. That said, the `SELECT` command is just a placeholder and does not switch between databases. And now, the Redis database mechanism is supported, and you can enable it by setting the `redis-database` to the database number you expect in the configuration file.

To be noticed, we don't allow using the namespace feature and the Redis database at the same time.
