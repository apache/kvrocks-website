| MIGRATE    | ✓                | v2.0.6        | Migrate slots between cluster nodes. |

:::note

To guarantee the correctness of client SDK, we rename the `CLUSTER` command to `CLUSTERX` to prevent the topology can being modified casually, but we can still use the `CLUSTER` command to fetch the cluster topology information.

:::note

The response of `DBSIZE` and keyspace section of `INFO` is updated asynchronously after executing `DBSIZE SCAN` command.

The `SELECT` command is a placeholder by default (`redis-databases = 0`). When `redis-databases` > 0, it switches between databases (0 to redis-databases-1). Database 0 uses the default namespace, databases 1-N use `db1`, `db2`, etc. Enabling this disables custom namespaces. Use [the namespace feature](https://kvrocks.apache.org/docs/namespace) for multiple isolated databases without `redis-databases`.
