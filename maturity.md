# Maturity Assessment for Apache Kvrocks (incubating)

The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.

More details can be found [here](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

## Status of this assessment

This assessment is still working in progress.
