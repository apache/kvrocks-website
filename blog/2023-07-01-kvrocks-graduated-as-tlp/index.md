### Kvrocks Overview & Advantages

Kvrocks is a distributed key value NoSQL database that uses RocksDB as storage engine and is compatible with Redis protocol. Users can decrease the cost of memory and increase the capacity compared to Redis.

### Kvrocks Feature Highlights

- Redis Compatible: Support common Redis data types and commands;
- Namespace: Similar to Redis DB but equipped with a token per namespace;
- Replication: Async replication using WAL of RocksDB;
- High Availability: Support Redis sentinel to failover when master failed; and
- Cluster: Centralized management but accessible via any Redis cluster client.
