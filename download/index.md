Choose a source distribution in either *tar* or *zip* format,
and [verify](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi#verify)
using the corresponding *pgp* signature (using the committer file in
[KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/kvrocks/KEYS)).
If you cannot do that, the *md5* hash file may be used to check that the
download has completed OK.

For fast downloads, current source distributions are hosted on mirror servers;
older source distributions are in the
[archive](https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/kvrocks/).
If a download from a mirror fails, retry, and the second download will likely
succeed.

For security, hash and signature files are always hosted at
[Apache](https://www.apache.org).
